Hi! Characters in this API are mostly handled by the folders. In the case of all built in characters, they are only handled by these folders.
However, more complicated characters will need a dedicated mod. This is NOT a mod creator, this is a mod tool.
Also, if you want to check if your a certain character in the case all your characters share the same code, you can do that via #char_(CHARACTERID)#
